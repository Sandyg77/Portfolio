          <p>
            I am passionate about traveling and exploring new places and
            cultures. My travels have taken me to vibrant destinations like
            Dubai, where I experienced the blend of modern architecture and rich
            traditions. Within Sri Lanka, I have visited beautiful sites like
            Gartmore Falls, Sigiriya, and many more breathtaking landscapes.
            These journeys allow me to appreciate diverse natural wonders and
            cultural heritage, sparking a deep appreciation for adventure and
            discovery.

          <p>
            Photography is one of my cherished hobbies, where I find joy in
            capturing beautiful and unique moments. My camera allows me to frame
            the world around me, especially landscapes and creative
            compositions. I've taken numerous photos during my travels and local
            explorations, capturing the beauty of places like Sri Lanka's lush
            greenery and Dubai's skyline. Here are a few of my favorite shots,
            which showcase my love for colors, nature, and storytelling through
            images.

          <p>
            Reading is my retreat, where I immerse myself in diverse genres that
            broaden my perspective and understanding. I enjoy novels that take
            me into other worlds, psychological books that explore the depths of
            the human mind, and self-improvement reads that help me grow. My
            interests span science fiction, historical narratives, and insights
            into human psychology, allowing me to continually expand my
            knowledge and awareness.

          <h4>Personal Finance Tracker | March 2024 - April 2024 |</h4>
          <p>
            I developed a "Personal Finance Tracker" application using Python,
            with Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). This project
            allows users to track income and expenses, visualize data, and
            manage budgets, demonstrating my ability to create practical
            solutions.

          <h4>Java</h4>
          <h4>Student Management System | June 2024 - August 2024|</h4>
          <p>
            As a java development project, I built a Student Management system
            to register students for a particular university intake. The users
            can find, delete, update, store, load, and view the list of students
            after sorting by name. This project was helpful in showcasing my
            ability to deliver solutions for real world problems.

          <h4>Vital Spark | April 2024 - May 2024 |</h4>
          <p>
            I developed a website which is focused on promoting good health and
            well-being. Designed the website with a modern and clean aesthetic,
            employing color gradients and CSS animations to enhance visual
            appeal. I created the shop for the website using JavaScript for
            functionality
